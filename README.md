# python-geometry

A Python module for working with 3D geometries. Written in Cython for speed.


## Background

This module was primarily written because a fast geometry library was necessary 
for another project, namely an implementation of the [image source method](https://github.com/FRidh/ism).

## Getting started

* Clone this repository
* `python setup.py install`

## Contributing
